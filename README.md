D3VacationFinder
======
#### A website that displays popular go-to places for a given vacation location.

D3VacationFinder is a website created for people who want to know quickly of popular points of interest in an area, along with other criteria entered in by the user.

  - City, State
  - Radius from Destination (aka driving distance)
  - Low, Medium, High Planned Spending (`$`, `$$`, `$$$`)
  - Taking a Family (`Yes` or `No`)
  - Variety of Categories of things to search from

This website features a smooth UI/UX to promote the idea that the website quickly helps find places to go to at your vacation spot.

#### Install and Run
To install and run the website locally, download the project and import as a `Maven` project in the IDE of your choice (I use `Intellij IDEA`). Go `D3VacationFinder/tree/master/Vacation-Finder/src/main/java/Frontend/main/main.java` and `Run`. Once a view lines have appeared and stopped appearing in the console, the website is ready to view at `localhost:8080`.
